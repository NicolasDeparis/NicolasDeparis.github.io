I'm part of the development team of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454.1012A"> EMMA: an AMR cosmological simulation code with radiative transfer
</a>.


<!-- Originally devloped at the Strasbourg Observatory by Dominique Aubert, EMMA is highly parallelized using MPI and CUDA. -->

I develop a python tool for EMMA outputs analyze named pyEMMA (available <a href="https://github.com/NicolasDeparis/pyemma">here</a>).

I am also a contributor of an online astronomical data visualization tool (not publicly available yet).
